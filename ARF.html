 <h2>U.S.S Enterprise (NCC 1701)</h2>
 <h3>The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) was a 23rd century Federation Constitution-class starship operated by Starfleet. It was also the first ship to bear the name Enterprise with this registry. Launched in 2245, the ship was commanded by Captain Robert April until 2250, when command of the ship was turned over to April's First Officer Christopher Pike. (TAS: "The Counter-Clock Incident"; DIS: "Brother")

During the Klingon War, the Enterprise and its crew were intentionally left out of the fighting by Starfleet Command as they considered the Enterprise to be the "best of Starfleet" and wanted them to survive. (DIS: "Project Daedalus")

Following the end of the war in 2257, the Enterprise was tasked with investigating one of a series of unidentified signals detected throughout the galaxy. Unfortunately the Enterprise suffered multiple catastrophic systems failures, leading the Enterprise to be towed back to spacedock and Pike to be transferred to command the USS Discovery to continue the mission of investigating the red bursts. (DIS: "Will You Take My Hand?", "Brother")

After several months of repairs, the Enterprise was returned to service with Captain Pike returned to command the ship and taking part in the battle with the Section 31 artificial intelligence Control. (DIS: "Such Sweet Sorrow", "Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2")

Pike's command of the Enterprise ended around 2265 when Pike was promoted to fleet captain and command of the ship was turned over to Captain James T. Kirk. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before", "The Menagerie, Part I")

In the course of its career, the Enterprise became the most celebrated starship of its time. It was later identified as "the original Enterprise" or "Kirk's ship". (DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations"; ENT: "These Are the Voyages...")

In its forty years of service and discovery, through upgrades and at least two refits, the Enterprise took part in numerous first contacts, military engagements, and time travels. The vessel achieved its most lasting fame from a five-year mission (2265-2270) under the command of Captain Kirk. (Star Trek: The Original Series; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; VOY: "Q2")</h3>
